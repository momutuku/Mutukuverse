@workspace i wnant to make a flutter application that has a couple of games, here are the games i nitend to build and a brief description 
Trivia
Build a trivia game! Store the correct answer to each question as well as incorrect ones for the user to guess between. Store the data either in a JSON or a database.

Flood
Flood is a surprisingly catchy game - the goal is to change the board to one color starting at the top left corner and traversing outward. I had a lot of fun building (and playing) this one.

Repeat after me
In this game, there’s a generated sequence that the user must mimic. If they do so correctly, they get another sequence that’s one longer than the previous.

Tic Tac Toe
The classic! Players place X’s and O’s on a grid aiming to get three in a row.

Tower of Hanoi
In this game, you will move disks from peg to peg, trying to move the stack to the final peg in the same pyramid shape.
